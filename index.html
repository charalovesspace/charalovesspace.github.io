							<h5 class="card-title">What is the universe?</h5>
							<p>The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you.
								Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons. Along with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun. The Sun is one among hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.

								The Milky Way is but one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe - all of them, including our own, are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. All the stars in all the galaxies and all the other stuff that astronomers can’t even observe are all part of the universe. It is, simply, everything.

							<h5 class="card-title">The Matter Of The Universe</h5>
							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Normal Matter</h6>
							<p>Normal matter consists of the atoms that make up stars, planets, human beings and every other visible object in the Universe. As humbling as it sounds, normal matter almost certainly accounts for the smallest proportion of the Universe, somewhere between 1% and 10%.
							</p>
							<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Dark Matter</h6>
							<p>Dark matter is composed of particles that do not absorb, reflect, or emit light, so they cannot be detected by observing electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is material that cannot be seen directly. We know that dark matter exists because of the effect it has on objects that we can observe directly.
								<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Dark Energy</h6>
								<p>Dark energy is the name given to the mysterious force that's causing the rate of expansion of our universe to accelerate over time, rather than to slow down. That's contrary to what one might expect from a universe that began in a Big Bang. Astronomers in the 20th century learned the universe is expanding. One example is called phantom dark energy, where not only is expansion accelerating, but the acceleration is also increasing over time. This leads to a scenario called the Big Rip, where expansion becomes infinitely fast, tearing galaxies, atoms and the fabric of space-time itself apart.
